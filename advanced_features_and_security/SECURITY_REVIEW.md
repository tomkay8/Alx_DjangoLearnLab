# Security Review

## Implemented Measures
- Forced HTTPS using `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.
- Enforced HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- Cookies (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`) only sent over HTTPS.
- Set `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY` to prevent clickjacking.
- Enabled `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` to prevent MIME-sniffing.
- Added `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` for legacy XSS protection.

## Contribution to Security
- These settings reduce risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Protect users against session hijacking and cookie theft.
- Prevent browsers from executing malicious code injections.
- Ensure the site can only be accessed securely.

## Areas for Improvement
- Regularly rotate SSL/TLS certificates.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for advanced protection.
- Monitor logs for potential attacks.
